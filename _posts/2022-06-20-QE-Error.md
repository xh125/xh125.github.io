## QUANTUM ESPRESSO常见报错以及解决方法  

### (1）Too many bands are not converged  

错误内容如下：  

```bash  
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     Error in routine c_bands (1):
     too many bands are not converged
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     stopping ...
```

相应的报错内容在QE/PW/src/c_bands.f90  

```fortran  
  IF ( notconv > MAX( 5, nbnd / 4 ) ) THEN
     !
     CALL errore( 'c_bands', 'too many bands are not converged', 1 )
     !
  ELSEIF ( notconv > 0 ) THEN
     !
     WRITE( stdout, '(5X,"c_bands: ",I2, " eigenvalues not converged")' ) notconv
     !
  ENDIF
```  

出现该报错的原因是notconv太大导致。
可以通过**1.increase ecutwfc; 2.decrease conv_thr; or both do them**来解决。

### （2） SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values  

出现该内容在输出文件中的内容：  

```bash
     Total force =     0.000018     Total SCF correction =     0.000015
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
```

在代码中的内容：  

```fortran  

  !
  sumfor = SQRT( sumfor )
  sumscf = SQRT( sumscf )
  !
  WRITE( stdout, '(/5x,"Total force = ",F12.6,5X, &
              &  "Total SCF correction = ",F12.6)') sumfor, sumscf
  !

  IF ( ( sumfor < 10.D0*sumscf ) .AND. ( sumfor > nat*eps ) ) &
  WRITE( stdout,'(5x,"SCF correction compared to forces is large: ", &
                   &  "reduce conv_thr to get better values")')
```
